# Internship Project - Web Application

This project was developed as part of our internship program by a team of 5 members.  
The application is a **website built using Java Spring Boot** for the backend.  
I contributed as a **Frontend Developer**, focusing on the **Lembaga Kesejahteraan Sosial (LKS) role** interface.

As the **Frontend Developer**, my main tasks were:
- Converting the design from the UI/UX team into responsive code  
- Developing the **LKS role interface** using **HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript**  
- Implementing pages for **routine reporting to the Social Service (Dinas Sosial)**  
- Ensuring the UI is user-friendly, responsive, and consistent with the provided design
